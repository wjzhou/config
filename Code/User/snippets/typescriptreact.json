	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"New React file": {
		"prefix": "rcui",
		"body": [
			"// Create by Wujun Zhou.",
			"// All Rights Reserved.",
			"import React from 'react';",
			"import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core'",
			"",
			"const useStyles = makeStyles({",
			"  root: {}",
			"});",
			"",
			"type Prop = {};",
			"",
			"export function ${TM_FILENAME_BASE}(prop: Prop) {",
			"    const classes = useStyles();",
			"    return (<div className={classes.root}>",
			"        $0",
			"    </div>);",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "new file"
