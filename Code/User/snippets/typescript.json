	// Place your snippets for typescript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Action": {
		"prefix": "ac",
		"body": [
			"",
			"export const ${1}Action = createAction(",
			"  '${TM_DIRECTORY/.*\\/(.*)\\/(.*)$/${2:/upcase}_/}${1/(^[a-z]+|[A-Z0-9][a-z]*)/_${1:/upcase}/g}' as const,",
			"  component",
			")<${2:undefined}>();",
			"export type ${1/^(.)/${1:/upcase}/}ActionType = ActionType<typeof ${1}Action>;",
			"$0"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	}
